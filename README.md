Key Points
Research suggests hedge funds may use 0 DTE options for short-term trading, focusing on debit-only strategies like buying calls, puts, straddles, and strangles.
It seems likely that these strategies are chosen for their potential to capture intraday price movements, with risks limited to the premium paid.
The evidence leans toward hedge funds using these strategies for speculation or hedging, but their success depends on precise timing and market conditions.
Direct Answer
Overview
Hedge funds likely use several debit-only options trading strategies with 0 DTE (zero days to expiration) options, which expire on the same trading day. These strategies involve only buying options, limiting risk to the premium paid, and are used for intraday speculation or hedging.
Strategies and Risk Profiles
Here are 10 potential strategies hedge funds might use, all debit-only and suitable for 0 DTE options:
Long Call on Individual Stocks: Buying a call option to profit if the stock price rises by the end of the day. Risk is the premium paid; profit potential is unlimited if the price increases.
Long Put on Individual Stocks: Buying a put option to profit if the stock price falls by the end of the day. Risk is the premium paid; profit potential is unlimited if the price decreases.
Long Call on Indices: Similar to individual stocks, but on indices like the S&P 500, betting on an upward move. Risk and reward follow the same pattern.
Long Put on Indices: Betting on a downward move in an index, with risk limited to the premium and unlimited profit potential downward.
Straddle on Individual Stocks: Buying a call and put at the same strike to profit from a big price move in either direction. Risk is the total premium; profit potential is high with significant movement.
Strangle on Individual Stocks: Buying a call and put at different strikes, also for big moves, with risk limited to the premium and high profit potential for large swings.
Straddle on Indices: Applying the straddle strategy to indices, expecting volatility in the broader market.
Strangle on Indices: Similar to stocks, but on indices, for capturing market-wide volatility.
Buying Out-of-the-Money Calls for Speculation: Purchasing calls unlikely to be in the money, for high-risk, high-reward bets on big upward moves.
Buying Out-of-the-Money Puts for Speculation: Purchasing puts unlikely to be in the money, for high-risk, high-reward bets on big downward moves.
An unexpected detail is that these strategies, while simple, require precise timing due to the short lifespan of 0 DTE options, making them more speculative than longer-term options strategies.
Considerations
These strategies are likely successful when hedge funds have strong intraday market insights, such as before news events or earnings announcements. However, their effectiveness can vary, and hedge funds may adapt based on market conditions.
Options Trading Strategies with 0 DTE Options: A Detailed Analysis for Hedge Funds
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the 10 most successful options trading strategies used by hedge funds, specifically limited to 0 DTE (zero days to expiration) options and debit-only trades, as of March 12, 2025. The focus is on strategies involving only buying options, excluding multi-leg credit trades, and their associated risk profiles.
Methodology and Context
The investigation began by understanding 0 DTE options, which are options that expire on the same day they are traded, making them suitable for intraday trading. These options are often used to capture short-term price movements or volatility, with a significant portion of equities options trading volume now consisting of contracts with less than 5 days to expiration, as noted by the CBOE Options Exchange (0DTE Options Explained). The user’s requirement for debit-only strategies means focusing on those where the trader buys options, limiting risk to the premium paid, and excluding strategies involving selling options for a net credit.
Given the complexity, the approach involved compiling a list of common debit-only options strategies and filtering for those applicable to 0 DTE options. Success was inferred from strategies frequently cited in financial resources and their alignment with hedge fund goals of generating alpha or managing risk in short time frames. Sources such as Investopedia and tastylive provided insights into 0 DTE trading, while hedge fund practices were inferred from general options trading literature and market trends.
Top 10 Options Trading Strategies and Risk Profiles
The following table lists the identified strategies, their descriptions, and risk profiles, synthesized from various sources and tailored to 0 DTE options:

Buying a put option on an index for a downward move.
Risk limited to premium paid; profit potential unlimited if index falls.

Risk limited to total premium paid; profit potential high with significant index movement.
Strangle on Indices
Buying call and put on an index at different strikes for market volatility.
Risk limited to total premium paid; profit potential high with large index swings.
Buying Out-of-the-Money Calls
Purchasing calls unlikely to be in the money for high-risk, high-reward bets.
Risk limited to premium paid; profit potential high if stock surges unexpectedly.
Buying Out-of-the-Money Puts
Purchasing puts unlikely to be in the money for high-risk, high-reward bets.
Risk limited to premium paid; profit potential high if stock drops significantly.
Detailed Strategy Analysis
Long Call on Individual Stocks: This strategy involves buying a call option on a stock, betting on an upward price movement by the end of the trading day. It’s a debit-only strategy, with risk limited to the premium paid, as detailed in How to Trade 0DTE Options. Hedge funds might use this for stocks expected to rise due to news or momentum.
Long Put on Individual Stocks: Similar to the long call, but for a downward move, buying a put option. This is suitable for hedging or speculating on negative price movements, with risk limited to the premium, as noted in 0DTE Options Trading.
Long Call on Indices: Applied to indices like the S&P 500, this strategy bets on a market-wide upward move. Given the high liquidity of index options, it’s a common choice for hedge funds, with risk and reward profiles similar to stock options.
Long Put on Indices: Betting on a market decline, this strategy is used for hedging portfolio risk or speculating on bearish market conditions, with risk limited to the premium paid.
Straddle on Individual Stocks: Buying both a call and put at the same strike price, this strategy profits from significant price movement in either direction, ideal for stocks with expected volatility, such as earnings announcements. Risk is the total premium, as described in 0DTE Options Explained.
Strangle on Individual Stocks: Similar to a straddle but with different strikes, this is cheaper but requires larger moves for profit. It’s a debit-only strategy, with risk limited to the premium, suitable for high-volatility scenarios.
Straddle on Indices: Applied to indices, this strategy bets on market volatility, such as during geopolitical events, with risk limited to the total premium paid.
Strangle on Indices: Similar to stocks, but on indices, for capturing broader market swings, with the same risk profile of limited premium.
Buying Out-of-the-Money Calls: Purchasing calls that are less likely to be in the money, this is a high-risk, high-reward strategy for speculative bets on big upward moves, often used before significant news, as mentioned in Unlock the Secrets of 0DTE Options.
Buying Out-of-the-Money Puts: Similar to out-of-the-money calls, but for downward moves, this strategy is for speculative bets on significant drops, with risk limited to the premium.
Unexpected Insight: Intraday Timing and Speculation
An unexpected detail is the emphasis on intraday timing, given the short lifespan of 0 DTE options. Hedge funds may use these strategies not just for hedging but for speculative purposes, such as capturing price movements around market open, mid-day, or before news announcements, requiring precise market insights and rapid execution.
Challenges and Limitations
The analysis faced challenges in obtaining specific performance data for hedge funds using 0 DTE options, as these strategies are often proprietary, and public databases like BarclayHedge provide aggregated indices without detailed breakdowns. The reliance on general sources means the ranking of "success" is inferred from theoretical profitability and frequency of use, rather than empirical data, which may vary by fund and market context.
Conclusion
This report provides a comprehensive overview of the 10 most likely successful options trading strategies used by hedge funds with 0 DTE options, all debit-only, with detailed risk profiles. While exact performance rankings are elusive, the strategies listed align with industry practices and are supported by reputable financial resources, offering a robust foundation for understanding hedge fund operations as of March 12, 2025.

ARGUMENT SUMMARY:
The transcript explains an advanced zero DTE options strategy using a short put vertical spread, detailing how the system works, its risk management, and related technical implementation.

─────────────────────────────

TRUTH CLAIMS:

1. CLAIM: Zero DTE options have minimal overnight risk and intense time decay.
   • CLAIM SUPPORT EVIDENCE:
     – Investopedia explains that options expiring on the same day experience rapid time decay (“theta decay”) and have almost no risk from overnight price changes. See: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/time-decay.asp.
     – Financial industry articles (e.g., pieces on zero days-to-expiration trading on sites like Benzinga or The Options Institute) note that same‐day expiries avoid overnight gaps.
   • CLAIM REFUTATION EVIDENCE:
     – Some market experts note that although overnight risk is negligible, the intraday volatility remains high and can lead to significant risk if the market moves unexpectedly. For example, discussions on intraday risk on financial forums like Elite Trader emphasize that “minimal overnight risk” does not equal “minimal overall risk.” (Reference: discussions summarized on https://www.optionseducation.org/).
   • LOGICAL FALLACIES:
     – Oversimplification: “no time for second guessing” may understate intraday uncertainty.
     – False dichotomy: Equating “minimal overnight risk” with overall low-risk might ignore other risk factors.
   • CLAIM RATING:
     – B (High)
   • LABELS:
     – Simplistic, Risk-Minimization, Partially Misleading

─────────────────────────────

2. CLAIM: A short put vertical spread caps losses while allowing premium collection.
   • CLAIM SUPPORT EVIDENCE:
     – Standard options trading theory (as explained on Investopedia’s Bull Put Spread page: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bull-put-spread.asp) confirms that such spreads have a defined risk (capped loss) with the premium received.
     – The Options Industry Council describes how spreads limit losses with a long put acting as a hedge.
   • CLAIM REFUTATION EVIDENCE:
     – Some analyses point out that although losses are capped, the risk relative to the premium can be significant if the market moves sharply. Articles on risk management in options (see options educational resources from the CBOE: https://www.cboe.com/education/) elaborate on these risk–reward nuances.
   • LOGICAL FALLACIES:
     – Oversimplification: Statement “caps losses” may neglect nuances in risk management.
     – Generalization: It implies that outcomes are uniformly favorable if the market behaves as predicted.
   • CLAIM RATING:
     – C (Medium)
   • LABELS:
     – Simplistic, Generalization

─────────────────────────────

3. CLAIM: Alpaca enforces a 3:15 p.m. ET cutoff for submitting orders for broad-based ETFs.
   • CLAIM SUPPORT EVIDENCE:
     – Alpaca’s official documentation confirms specific order cutoffs to allow for proper auto-liquidation risk management. See: https://alpaca.markets/docs/api-documentation/ for details on trading cutoffs and risk controls.
   • CLAIM REFUTATION EVIDENCE:
     – There is minimal evidence refuting this, though trading platforms sometimes update policies. Independent trader reviews and community posts on Alpaca’s status pages (e.g., Alpaca’s blog or support forums) consistently mention these cutoffs.
   • LOGICAL FALLACIES:
     – None identified.
   • CLAIM RATING:
     – A (Definitely True)
   • LABELS:
     – Specific, Technical

─────────────────────────────

4. CLAIM: The provided code is only for demonstration and requires further adaptation before live trading.
   • CLAIM SUPPORT EVIDENCE:
     – Standard disclaimers in financial and algorithmic trading tutorials (as found on Investopedia and official broker educational resources) routinely note that example code is not production-ready.
     – Alpaca’s own educational materials and risk disclosures consistently state that initial code examples are starting points for further testing.
   • CLAIM REFUTATION EVIDENCE:
     – There is little refutation since the advisory nature of educational content is common practice; independent experts (e.g., in academic journals or well‐established trading courses) advise rigorous backtesting and adaptation before live deployment.
   • LOGICAL FALLACIES:
     – None identified.
   • CLAIM RATING:
     – A (Definitely True)
   • LABELS:
     – Cautionary, Disclaimer

─────────────────────────────

OVERALL SCORE:
   • LOWEST CLAIM SCORE: C
   • HIGHEST CLAIM SCORE: A
   • AVERAGE CLAIM SCORE: B

─────────────────────────────

OVERALL ANALYSIS:
The argument is detailed and technically thorough, yet it occasionally oversimplifies risk aspects. Its strength lies in clear explanations; revising to deepen discussion of intraday risks could further refine its balance.
